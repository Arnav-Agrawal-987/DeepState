Deep State – Game Logic Specification
1. Core Concept
Deep State is a systemic strategy game about maintaining structural relevance within a network of institutions that are continuously attempting to stabilize, reform, or marginalize hidden influence. The player does not control a character, faction, or government; instead, the player represents a distributed latent force — the Deep State.
There is no win condition. The game ends only when the Deep State becomes irrelevant during a major systemic crisis. Score is measured in days survived.
Design Philosophy: - Power is indirect - Control is delayed - Stability is dangerous - Crisis is inevitable

2. Layered Game State Model
The entire game state is organized into strict layers. Each layer has clear ownership and mutation rules. Violating these rules breaks systemic consistency.
________________________________________
2.1 Static Context Layer (World Context)
This layer defines the immutable environment of a run.
Contents:
•	Selected region / nation
•	Region identity and metadata
Rules:
•	Loaded once at game start from RegionConfig
•	Never modified during play
•	Currently contains no gameplay modifiers
•	Queried only for region identity and institutional setup
Design Note: At this stage of development, regions have no demographic or geographic modifiers. All gameplay variation between regions is driven entirely by:
•	The set of institutions present
•	The initial institutional dependency graph
Future expansion may introduce modifiers, but the simulation must function correctly without them.
________________________________________
2.2 Institutional Layer
Institutions are semi-autonomous agents that form the backbone of the simulation.
Examples: - Policy - Military - Judiciary - Media - Police
Each institution exists for the entire duration of the game and cannot collapse or be removed.
________________________________________
2.2.1 Institution Types (Content Classification)
Each institution has a type used exclusively for content, flavor, and UI logic. These types do not affect simulation mechanics.
Institution Types: - Militant – Armed or coercive bodies (military, paramilitary, special forces) - Civilian – Public-facing or service institutions (media, education, welfare) - Policy – Lawmaking and executive bodies (legislature, ministries) - Intelligence – Secretive or information-focused institutions (intelligence agencies, surveillance bodies)
Rules: - Institution type never modifies numeric mechanics - Types gate: - Event tree content - UI presentation - Flavor text and narrative framing
________________________________________
2.2.2 Institution State
Each institution maintains the following internal state:
•	Capacity – Ability to self-regulate and act autonomously
•	Strength – Maximum stress tolerance
•	Stress – Accumulated pressure from player actions, dependencies, and events
•	Player Influence (0–100) – How embedded the Deep State is within the institution
All values are bounded and persist across days.
________________________________________
2.2.3 Institutional Intelligence
Institutions are not strategic planners. They act according to deterministic local rules.
Daily behavior: 1. Increase strength by a function of capacity 2. Probabilistically trigger a stable event if stress is low 3. Trigger a stress event if stress ≥ strength
Post-crisis behavior: - Attempt to rewire local dependency graph edges to improve resilience
Institutions never: - Choose event outcomes - Apply buffs or debuffs directly - Access player state directly
________________________________________
2.3 Institutional Dependency Graph
Institutions are connected via a directed, weighted dependency graph.
Examples: - Judiciary → Police - Media → Public Trust - Policy → Budget Allocation
Properties: - Nodes: Institutions - Edges: Dependency strength (float) - Fully mutable
Rules: - Modified only by events or institutional post-crisis actions - Rewired globally after every crisis - Used to propagate stress, modifiers, and influence pressure
This graph is the primary structural power surface of the game.
________________________________________
2.4 Player State (The Deep State)
The player is a systemic actor, not a character.
Player Resources: - Cash – Fungible resource - Bandwidth – Limits how many actions can be taken per day - Exposure – Visibility of the Deep State
Exposure Rules: - Naturally decays over time - Increased by aggressive or frequent actions - Modifies event availability and outcomes - Influences relevance calculations during crises
The player never directly manipulates institutions; all effects occur through actions and events.
________________________________________
3. Event System
Events are the primary mechanism of change in the simulation. All meaningful state mutation outside of direct player actions occurs through events.
________________________________________
3.1 Events
Events are local and frequent, always associated with a specific institution.
Sources: 1. Stress-triggered events – Occur when institution stress exceeds strength - Usually beneficial to the player - Represent leaks, fractures, dissent
2.	Stable-triggered events – Occur probabilistically when an institution is stable
o	Usually harmful to the player
o	Represent reforms, audits, internal cleanup
Effects: - Modify institution stats - Modify player resources - Adjust influence values - Increase global tension
Each institution has two event trees, one per event source type.
________________________________________
3.2 Global Tension
Global tension is a single scalar value representing systemic strain.
Rules: - Increased by every event - Cannot decrease naturally - Triggers crises when threshold is crossed
________________________________________
3.3 Crises
Crises represent systemic inflection points.
Examples: - Constitutional reform - Coup attempt - Judicial purge - Media exposé
Trigger: - Global tension exceeds threshold
Properties: - Has an epicenter institution - Uses a global crisis event tree - Causes all institutions to rewire dependencies
Resolution: - Calculates Deep State relevance - If relevance < threshold → game over - Otherwise, tension partially resets and play continues
Crises are the only point where loss is possible.
________________________________________
4. Daily Simulation Cycle
Time advances in discrete days.
Daily Order (Strict): 1. Day Start 2. Institutions auto-update 3. Minor events triggered and resolved 4. Global tension updated 5. Crisis (if triggered) 6. Player turn 7. Day End
This order is enforced by the SimulationClock and must never be bypassed.
________________________________________
5. Player Actions
The player may: - Convert resources (cash ↔ bandwidth) - Apply pressure to institutions (increase stress, reduce capacity) - Make decisions during events
Action Constraints: - Tiered by player influence - Limited by bandwidth - Increase exposure
________________________________________
6. Loss Condition
The player does not lose by running out of resources.
The player loses when: > A crisis determines the Deep State is no longer structurally relevant within the institutional network.
This evaluation considers: - Influence distribution - Dependency graph centrality - Exposure - Institutional stability

7. Data Modeling & Implementation Structure
7.1 Core Data Objects
The game is implemented using a small set of authoritative data objects. Each object has a single responsibility and clear ownership rules.

8. Menu & World Map Flow
The game uses a region-based meta-structure. Each region represents an independent simulation run.
8.1 Main Menu
The main menu presents:
•	Play Game
•	Quit
8.2 World Map Selection
When entering the game, the player is shown a world map.
World Map Behavior:
•	Each playable region is a clickable area
•	Selecting a region displays:
o	Region name
o	Brief institutional overview
o	Whether a saved game exists
Selection Rules:
•	If no save exists for the region → start a new run
•	If a save exists and the region is not lost → resume that run
•	If the region has been lost → region shows high score and start a new run
8.3 Multiple Concurrent Regions
•	Each region has an independent save file
•	The player may have multiple active regions at once
•	Progress in one region does not affect others
The world map functions as a meta-layer, not part of the simulation itself.

9. Design Guarantees
•	Institutions never collapse
•	Crises are inevitable
•	Stability is a threat
•	Survival requires balance, not domination
________________________________________
10. Summary
Deep State is a systemic survival game about managing invisible power inside complex institutions. The player’s challenge is not to win, but to remain necessary.
